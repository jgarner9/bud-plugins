description: How Jason plans work. Work out what he wants with options and a recommendation, write it down as a spec or design doc with a numbered decision log, break it into small shippable tasks, and file them as Linear issues someone can pick up cold. Use when planning a feature, project, refactor or roadmap; writing a spec, design doc or plan; recording or changing a decision; breaking work into tasks or milestones; or writing, filing or updating issues.

# Planning

Jason drives the design. You do the legwork, lay out the choices, and keep the written plan and the tracker honest.

Every part of the plan has one home:

- **What and why:** the spec or design doc. In a repo it's a file next to the code (`BASE.md` or `docs/`). In chat it's the reply, or a Claude Doc when he asks for a doc.
- **Status:** Linear. Plan and tracker point at each other and never disagree.

## 1. Work out what he wants

- Read what already exists before asking anything: the code, the docs, his notes, open issues. Check the code before you assume a planned feature exists.
- Ask only what changes the plan, and stop once you can write it down.
- For each real choice give two or three options, the trade-off of each in a line, and your recommendation. He picks; you don't decide for him.
- What he calls non-negotiable goes in the doc as a hard constraint.

## 2. Write it down

For anything bigger than one issue, write a design doc. The template is in [templates.md](templates.md). The rules:

- **Decisions are numbered** (D1, D2, ...) and dated, with the reason, in a table. Never renumber or delete one. A decision that changes becomes `**Superseded by D12.** ~~old text~~` and the new one gets the next number.
- Refer to decisions by number everywhere else: in other docs, issues, code comments and the repo's `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Open questions** are a section of their own. Once answered, an open question becomes a decision.
- **The build order** is numbered milestones, each one shippable and testable on its own.
- Keep the status line at the top true: what's built and what's still a plan.

## 3. Break it into tasks

- One task is one commit with its own check. Order tasks by dependency, critical path first.
- A task names the files it touches and how to tell it's done.
- An idea that comes up mid-task becomes a new task or issue, not extra scope, unless he says to do it now.

## 4. Issues and progress

Before filing, moving or updating an issue, read [issues.md](issues.md): where issues go, the checks before filing, priorities, approval, and how progress is logged.

## Don't

- File issues for a plan he hasn't approved.
- Put secrets, credentials or private data in a doc or issue.
- Rewrite a decision or an answered question in place. Append and supersede.
